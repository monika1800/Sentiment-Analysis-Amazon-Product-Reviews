1. Sentiment analysis: Create a model to predict the overall rating/opinion of a given review text. You may choose the granularity (1-5 or Positive, Neutral, Negative) as you wish. Also find the most predictive text features (for ex. words, bigrams etc.) for the sentiment.

2. Topic extraction: What are the commonly mentioned features (for example, important features of a phone could be the battery life, quality of display, touch etc.) of the different products? What are the different terms used that correspond to a given feature or category? As there are no labels for this task, you will have to use unsupervised techniques. Also consider doing a simple token frequency analysis. Bonus points if you can also find an overall sentiment score for each feature or category.
